Project

In this project I will be creating an Todo-list app.

Features:
1) The User will be able to create tasks by pressing a '+' button. This action will cause a test box to appear.

2) Using the new box, the user will be able to describe the contents of the task

3) The user will also be asked to assign a value to the task [Trivial] [Easy] [Medium] [Hard]. 'Trivial' is the default if none are selected

4) Once step 2 & 3 Are completed, there will be another option 'âœ“' to upload the task to the page.

5) When a task is present, there will be a a checkbox which allows the user to check off the task as 'completed'

6) Once the item has been checked off they will have a line go through it and the item will be removed from the list shortly after. Based on the difficulty of the task, a point will be given to the user.

7) If the user does not complete a task above 'trivial' after 24 hours it will take away health regardless of the difficulty
