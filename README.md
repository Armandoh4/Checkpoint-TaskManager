## Introduction

'Task Manager' (TM) is a checklist app which allows users to create "list items," representing their real world goals and tasks. The purpose of this app is to allow th user to keep track of their active tasks in real time. The app allows the user to create new tasks, and add/remove the tasks from the list.

TM is an app hosted localy and keeps track of what the user inputs onto the local host. The app prioritises a minimalistic design, aiming for maximum function and providing good utility for the user.

## User Experience:
---
### First Time Visitor GOAL

     1 - To create and delete tasks, keeping track of their todolist
     2 - Users who suffer from memory loss, or ADHD may be more inclined to use such checklists. This tool would rovide them a method to free up thinking space, without creating mental or physical clutter (planning sheets)
     3 -

### Returning Visitor Goal
In this project I will be creating an Todo-list app.

    1 - Repeat users may find other uses for this app, such as using it like a grocery list

1) The User will be able to create tasks by pressing a '+' button. This action will cause a test box to appear.

2) Using the new box, the user will be able to describe the contents of the task

3) The user will also be asked to assign a value to the task [Trivial] [Easy] [Medium] [Hard]. 'Trivial' is the default if none are selected

4) Once step 2 & 3 Are completed, there will be another option 'âœ“' to upload the task to the page.

5) When a task is present, there will be a a checkbox which allows the user to check off the task as 'completed'

6) Once the item has been checked off they will have a line go through it and the item will be removed from the list shortly after. Based on the difficulty of the task, a point will be given to the user.

7) If the user does not complete a task above 'trivial' after 24 hours it will take away health regardless of the difficulty
